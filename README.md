## Hi there üëã
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on Python implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on data-centric projects: ML, Backend development, Data engineering projects etc.
# üí´About Me :
I am a Python engineer that's passionate about optimizations and making things run efficiently and smoothly. That was partially a reason I started working with Rust for it's safety and efficiency. Currently, I am working at appose GmbH: a startup in a lovely Heidelberg city. We do job market analysis, matching skills to roles, providing customers with the overview and recomendation for their workforce competencies and many more. I am personally responsible for a recommendation service that takes information from over 70 million data points and make a perfect recommendation system for which skills are required in today's market, as well as analyze trends between skills and roles in various industries. 

My strong sides are 
- data science (analysis, exploration, cleaning, modeling)
- machine learning (vast experience with Torch and Tensorflow + my thesis involved Reinforcement Learning and MuZero agent)
- backend development
- CI-related tasks: tests, containerization (Docker) and deployment via Gitlab CI
